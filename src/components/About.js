                    I am a freelance front-end developer currently based in Wroc≈Çaw, Poland.
                    I specialize in responsive web design and development.
                    My belief is that we can make internet better together by collaborating and creating
                    beautiful and functional websites.

                    Few years ago, I started experimenting with HTML and CSS. I became very fond of coding and minimalistic designs. Since then I am trying to become better at what I do.

                    I am a relentless learner. What I love most about front-end development is the constant changes in the field especially it's evolution in the last couple of years.

                    I love working and collaborating with people. 
                    For me it does not matter whether the client wants me to create a site based on content management system, such as
                    WordPress or completely from scratch. I always do my best to match and exceed expectations and appreciate 
                    when people tell the truth.

                        I have a degree in teaching English language as a second language and on the way of receiving master's
                        degree in logistics. I came a long way before I understood what I like to do. This is why I value every
                        bit of knowledge and experience I get. Below is the list of things I learned for the last year.
